  <p class="lead">Bootstrap (v. 3.3.7) has a few easy ways to quickly get started, each one appealing to a different skill level and use case. Read through to see what suits your particular needs.</p>

  <h2 id="download-autoprefixer">Autoprefixer required for Less/Sass</h2>
  <p>Bootstrap uses <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> to deal with <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/css/a/css-vendor-prefixes.htm">CSS vendor prefixes</a>. If you're compiling Bootstrap from its Less/Sass source and not using our Gruntfile, you'll need to integrate Autoprefixer into your build process yourself. If you're using precompiled Bootstrap or using our Gruntfile, you don't need to worry about this because Autoprefixer is already integrated into our Gruntfile.</p>
