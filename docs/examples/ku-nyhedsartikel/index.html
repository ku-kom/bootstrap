        <h1 class="title">Health researchers find solution to life-threatening side effect</h1>

        <div class="manchet">
          <span>Paracetamol</span>
          <p>Through studies of rats, researchers from the University of Copenhagen may have found the reason behind of a large drop in blood pressure in patients receiving intravenous pain medication.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>Most people know about the painkiller paracetamol, commonly used against headaches and ingested orally.</p>
        <p>However, in hospitals, paracetamol is administered intravenously. In this way, doctors and nurses can help critically ill patients who are unable to swallow one or more pills.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the substance acts much faster intravenously, and the method allows healthcare professionals to control the doses and the timing of their effect very precisely.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the intravenous paracetamol has a serious side effect: namely, a temporary large drop in blood pressure.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>‘Previous studies suggest it is quite a sizable drop. We are, for example, talking about drops in the range of up to 20-25 mm Hg from a systolic pressure of 120, and we now believe that we know the mechanism underlying this dangerous side
          effect’, says Assistant Professor Thomas Qvistgaard Jepps from the <span><a href="https://bmi.ku.dk/english/" title="Link to the homepage of the Department of Biomedical Sciences">Department of Biomedical Sciences</a></span>.</p>
        <p>He adds that the drop in blood pressure is found in both common and critically ill patients. In the latter category, six out of ten have been reported to experience the side effect. One third of these to such an extent that it requires
          medical intervention.</p>
        <p>This research is rather timely, given the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and dramatic increase in critically ill patients that maybe receiving intravenous paracetamol in the hospitals to help with pain and fever management.</p>
